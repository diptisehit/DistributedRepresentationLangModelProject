# Understanding Distributed Representations
Distributed representations are a fundame7ntal concept in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). They refer to a way of representing data, typically words or phrases, as continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space. Unlike local representations, where each entity is represented by a unique identifier in an isolated manner (such as one-hot encoding), distributed representations capture a notion of similarity and semantic meaning by allowing an entity to be represented by a pattern of values across many dimensions.
